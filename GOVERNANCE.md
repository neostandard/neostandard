## Lead Maintainers

Neostandard Lead Maintainers are the organization owners.
They are the only members of the `@neostandard/leads` team. The Lead
Maintainers are the curators of the Neostandard project and their key responsibility
is to issue releases of Neostandard and its dependencies.

Lead maintainers are responsible for releases.

## Collaborators

Neostandard Collaborators maintain the projects of the Neostandard organization.

Both Collaborators and non-Collaborators may propose changes to the source code
of the projects of the organization. The mechanism to propose such a change is a
GitHub pull request. Collaborators review and merge (_land_) pull requests
following the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

### Collaborator activities

* Helping users and novice contributors
* Contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project
* Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests
* Merging pull requests

The Lead Maintainers can remove inactive Collaborators or provide them with
_Past Collaborators_ status. Past Collaborators may request that the Lead
Maintainers restore them to active status.

## Great Contributors

Great contributors on a specific area in the Neostandard ecosystem will be invited
to join this group by Lead Maintainers. This group has the same permissions of a
contributor.

## Collaborator nominations

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions to the project may be
a candidate to join the Neostandard organization.

A Collaborator needs to open a private team discussion on GitHub and list the
candidates they want to sponsor with a link to the user's contributions. For
example:

* Activities in the Neostandard organization
  `[USERNAME](https://github.com/search?q=author:USERNAME+org:neostandard)`

Otherwise, a Contributor may self-apply if they believe they meet the above
criteria by reaching out to a Lead Maintainer privately with the links to their
valuable contributions. That Lead Maintainer will then open a private team discussion on
GitHub regarding that and reply back when a decision has been made.

The consensus to grant a new candidate Collaborator status is reached when:

- at least one of the Lead Maintainers approve
- at least two of the Team Members approve

## Lead Maintainers nominations

A Team Member may be promoted to a Lead Maintainers only through nomination by a
Lead maintainer and with agreement from the rest of Lead Maintainers.

## Consensus seeking process

The Neostandard organization follows a Lazy [Consensus Seeking][] decision-making model,
inspired by the ASF

Lazy means that silence is consent if an appropriate amount of time has passed
(most of the time: at least a week) since the suggestion was made and no objections
has been raised.

This only holds true if all relevant parties has been notified of the suggestion
and given the opportunity to take part. Eg. extra care needs to be taken during
holiday and vacation times.

Decision makers should strive to give active consent and not actively wait out
silent consent.
