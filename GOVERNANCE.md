## Lead Maintainers

Neostandard Lead Maintainers are the organization owners.
They are the only members of the `@neostandard/leads` team. The Lead
Maintainers are the curators of the Neostandard project and their key responsibility
is to issue releases of Neostandard and its dependencies.

Lead maintainers are responsible for releases.

## Collaborators

Neostandard Collaborators maintain the projects of the Neostandard organization.

Both Collaborators and non-Collaborators may propose changes to the source code
of the projects of the organization. The mechanism to propose such a change is a
GitHub pull request. Collaborators review and merge (_land_) pull requests
following the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

### Collaborator activities

* Helping users and novice contributors
* Contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project
* Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests
* Participation in working groups
* Merging pull requests

The Lead Maintainers can remove inactive Collaborators or provide them with
_Past Collaborators_ status. Past Collaborators may request that the Lead
Maintainers restore them to active status.

## Great Contributors

Great contributors on a specific area in the Neostandard ecosystem will be invited
to join this group by Lead Maintainers. This group has the same permissions of a
contributor.

## Collaborator nominations

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions to the project may be
a candidate to join the Neostandard organization.

A Collaborator needs to open a private team discussion on GitHub and list the
candidates they want to sponsor with a link to the user's contributions. For
example:

* Activities in the Neostandard organization
  `[USERNAME](https://github.com/search?q=author:USERNAME+org:neostandard)`

Otherwise, a Contributor may self-apply if they believe they meet the above
criteria by reaching out to a Lead Maintainer privately with the links to their
valuable contributions. The Lead Maintainers will reply to the Contributor and
will decide if candidate it to be made a collaborator.

The consensus to grant a new candidate Collaborator status is reached when:

- at least one of the Lead Maintainers approve
- at least two of the Team Members approve

## Lead Maintainers nominations

A Team Member may be promoted to a Lead Maintainers only through nomination by a
Lead maintainer and with agreement from the rest of Lead Maintainers.

## Consensus seeking process

The Neostandard organization follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision-making model.
In case of a Collaborator objection to a specific change, the Lead Maintainers can
vote to override the objection.

For all votes, a simple majority of all Lead Maintainers for, or against, the
issue wins. A Lead Maintainer member may choose to participate in any vote through
abstention.
